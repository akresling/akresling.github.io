Welcome to my site. 

This post is the first of many, and it would be fitting in it to explain how this site came to be.

I prefer algorithm puzzles and coding challanges to navigation bar design and colour palettes. Needless to say, the making of this website was a learning experience for me. 

* Fonts are  big deal, can you tell that there are two different fonts on the site?
* A pleasing colour palette is really important, the background is not even white.

Design is vital to the enjoyment of a product or website. Many software engineers (myself included) tend to forget how important the users experience can be. We put all our focus on the background problem of code organization and architecture. Often times though, none of that stuff plays any role at all in how the consumer will use your product. They just care that it looks nice and does what it is intended for.

So with the help of one of my [great friends](http://ursulasarracini.com/), I learned many important concepts related to the look and feel of a website.

Stayed tuned for more posts.
